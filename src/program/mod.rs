//! Parsing and handling program syntax(es) of the shell.
//!
//! Both, commands entered to the shell interactively through STDIN, and read
//! from a file, are *programs*. Our shell provides multiple discrete languages
//! to write programs in, each with a corresponding implementation of this
//! module's `Program` trait.
//!
//! ### `{@}` Language Blocks
//!
//! Both the [`posix`](posix) and [`modern`](modern) languages have support for
//! a special expression which treats the body as a program from another
//! language. This forms the basis of oursh's modern features, and backwards
//! compatibility. While the primary goal of this syntax is to be able to mix
//! both POSIX and non-POSIX shell scripts, the feature is much more powerful.
//! Any interperator can be used, just like with `#!`.
//!
//! ```sh
//! date      # Call `date` in the default syntax.
//! {@ date}  # Specifies the alternate syntax.
//!
//! # Use ruby, why not...
//! {@!ruby
//!     require 'date'
//!     puts Date.today
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Strict POSIX compatibility can be enabled by removing this feature alone.
//!
//! ### Default Syntax
//!
//! Our shell has a `PrimaryProgram` which is in charge of parsing programs
//! which are not passed in via a `{@}` language block. This can be configured
//! to your preference. This does not effect the shell when launched in
//! POSIX compatibility mode, or when a specific default language is passed
//! as a flag.
//!
//! ### POSIX Syntax
//!
//! The basic, portable POSIX shell language. For detailed information read the
//! [`posix`](posix) module docs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! a=0
//! b=1
//! for ((i=0; i<10; i++))
//! do
//!     echo -n "$a "
//!     fn=$((a + b))
//!     a=$b
//!     b=$fn
//! done
//! echo
//! ```
//!
//! ### Modern Syntax
//!
//! A more modern and ergonomic language. For more detailed information read
//! the [`modern`](modern) module docs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! # WIP
//! var a = 0
//! var b = 1
//! for i in 0..10 {
//!     echo -n "$a "
//!     let fn = $((a + b))
//!     a = $b
//!     b = $fn
//! }
//! echo
//! ```
//!
//! ### TODO
//!
//! - Parse sequence of programs from stream.
//! - Partial parses for readline-ish / syntax highlighting.
